# Welcome to netperf.bufferbloat.net

**netperf** is a network performance measurement tool ([github.com/HewlettPackard/netperf/](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/netperf/blob/master/README)</a>).
It relies on programs running on separate computers:

* a **netserver** program that listens for commands from ... 
* a **netperf client** that sends those commands at the user's direction.

This server is a **netserver**.
The **netperf client** tells the netserver to send or receive streams of data
between the two devices and then measures the data transfer rates between them.

This server is only available to those who use the passphrase - see below.
